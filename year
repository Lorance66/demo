This year has been a challenging year in general, and I have worked in three phases this year.
In the first phase, I worked with hacn huangpu pod team and team members on continuous delivery. The first phase was working with the team members in the hacn huangpu pod team on continuous delivery. We completed the delivery targets with teammates efficiently and steadily.
The second phase is to work alone on the platform migration, communicate with GSC global, follow global guidelines to complete our IKP platform 'hello world' and demo project. and develop ikp widget to initialize ikp platform related configuration.
In the third phase I came to HASE PIB wealth team to do investment related projects. I worked with F/E and B/E to complete integration testing and deliver to production. It was an enriching and memorable teamwork experience with some great colleagues. Worked with relevant business experts, stepping out of my comfort zone and gaining experience that is hard to replace.

Overall the three phases of work challenged me a lot and improved my communication and technical skills. I would like to thank my leaders and colleagues for their support and understanding.
